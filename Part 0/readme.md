# Introduction to Modern Web Application Development

In this part, we have a first glance with the course. 
After that, we will have an overview of the basics of web development and also talk about the advances in web application development during the last few decades.

Before we start programming, we will go through some principles of web development by examining an example application at https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp.

The application exists only to demonstrate some basic concepts of the course, and is, by no means, an example of how a modern web application should be made. On the contrary, it demonstrates some old techniques of web development, which could even be considered bad practices nowadays.
